            Recovery Crew
            Recovery drive around the outside of the circuit to pick up bikes and riders
            who need taking back to the paddock at the end of each session. They only enter the circuit and the express command of race control.
            Recovery also provide a taxi service for marshals at the start of a days racing to their assigned posts, and also at the end of the days racing from their assigned posts.
