        <h1>So what is a marshal?</h1>
        <p class="text1">
            Course marshals
            The course marshals ensure that all required emergency equipment are in place and ready to respond
            to an incident at a moment's notice. They are to give consistent information to riders with racing flags
            and signals; assess the track surface condition; observe competitors for riding behavior and their motorcycles'
            mechanical condition; help riders and others in an incident; and communicate information to the stewards who 
            are in charge of the event and rely on the accuracy of the marshals' reports to make correct decisions.
